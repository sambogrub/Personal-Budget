## tkinter
 - use buttons instead of labels
 - make it simple and just have the category buttons be all that change the content of the detail frames
 - make the buttons, progress bars, and other updated widgets persistant, only updating the content and not replacing
 - use anchor 'N' for buttons and other things to have a relative pos in the center
 - use just one new toplevel window for everything; errors, addition of items, edit items, etc.
   - then hide or place/pack the frames to hide or reveal what is needed
   - buttons with hide or move frames to correct placement
